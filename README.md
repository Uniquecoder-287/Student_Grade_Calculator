# 🎯 Student Grade Calculator

A Python-based tool that calculates student grades and provides motivational feedback. This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in Python fundamentals.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Validation:** Ensures marks are between 0 and 100 using `while` loops.
- **Error Handling:** Prevents crashes if a user enters text instead of numbers.
- **Logic:** Uses a dedicated function to determine grades (A-F).
- **Personalized:** Returns the student's name and a unique message.

## 📊 Grading Scale
